## 🌐 Global Introduction

This project aims to explore the transcriptomic changes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using RNA-seq data. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to identify key biological processes and molecular pathways involved in RA pathogenesis.

## 🧾 Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints. This project investigates gene expression profiles to identify immune-related pathways and regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to disease progression.
